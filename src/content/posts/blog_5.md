Let’s get this out of the way:

No one clicks your About page thinking,  
“I can’t wait to learn about this founder’s childhood.”

They click because they’re asking one thing:

> Can I trust this business?

Most About pages miss that completely.

They read like biographies.

“I started this company in 2016…”  
“I’ve always been passionate about…”  
“Our mission is to empower…”

None of that is wrong.

It’s just incomplete.

## Why People Actually Click “About”

They’re not researching you out of curiosity.

They’re validating a decision.

They’ve seen your homepage.  
Maybe your services.  
Maybe your pricing.

Now they’re thinking:

- Are these people legit?
- Do they understand businesses like mine?
- Are they credible?
- Will this be a mistake?

Your About page isn’t a resume.

It’s a reassurance tool.

## The Problem With Founder-Focused Copy

Here’s the common structure:

- Long origin story  
- Personal philosophy  
- Vague mission statement  
- Stock photo handshake  

It turns into a story about you.

But the reader is still thinking about themselves.

Always.

People don’t buy because of your journey.  
They buy because they see themselves in it.

## Reframe the Page

Instead of:

“I started this agency because I love design.”

Try:

“We help small businesses turn websites into revenue-generating assets.”

See the shift?

The first is about you.  
The second is about them.

That doesn’t mean remove your story.

It means position it properly.

## A Better Structure for Your About Page

If you want it to convert, structure it like this:

### 1. Start With The Customer

Open by speaking to their frustration or goal.

Why are they here?

What are they struggling with?

Show you understand the problem first.

---

### 2. Introduce Your Approach

Now explain how you solve it.

Not in buzzwords.

In outcomes.

What changes after working with you?

What becomes easier?

What improves?

---

### 3. Add Proof

This is where credibility matters.

Experience.  
Results.  
Testimonials.  
Photos of real work.  

Trust grows when evidence appears.

---

### 4. Then Share Your Story

Now it’s relevant.

Your background becomes context, not the headline.

People don’t need your life story.

They need confidence.

---

## The Subtle Truth

An About page done well builds authority without bragging.

It signals:

We understand your problem.  
We’ve solved it before.  
We can solve it again.

That’s what people are scanning for.

Not your hobbies.

Not your childhood dream.

Not your coffee preference.

## Quick Test

Open your About page right now.

Count how many times you use:

- “I”
- “We”
- “Our”

Then count how many times you use:

- “You”
- “Your”

If the first group dominates, you know what to fix.

Your About page isn’t a biography.

It’s a bridge.

If it’s not building trust, it’s wasting space.

And wasted space doesn’t convert.

If your About page talks more about you than your customer—
